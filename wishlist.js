/*

// WISHLIST!

-- fail submissions

-- show history of round

-- % chance of you pulling off a move, aka how good you are at it

-- feature where you can attempt a move but won't make it

-- mode to hide moveslist, or type in the move you want to do

-- opponent will occasionally perform moves against you (time based, round based, how to implement?)

-- add executed moves to history list (not just positions)

-- click position in history list to return to that postion

-- a way to chain moves together. example you don't hit the arm bar from whatever position, but you can chain in a different move you might normally not be able to do. (inspired by that bottom side control video)


// BUGS!

-- sometimes a bad position is grabbed from position array, why?
