/*

// WISHLIST!


-- Customize the skill level of your opponent
    -- % chance that AI will do a move against you
    -- % chance that AI will defend a move you do against them
    -- diff % chances for position changes vs submissions/chokes?
    -- how likely you can defend or counter their moves (if using random button to decide)


-- combine video urls and regular link urls into the same property, add a 'type' key

-- ability to put together a 'plan' -- aka, perform this sweep, then execute this submission, then if that fails go for something else. at any point the AI will do offense/defense against you (if toggled on)

-- ability to mark off moves that you want more practice at. it will output a little list for you to refer to

-- mode to hide moveslist, or type in the move you want to do

-- click position in history list to return to that postion

-- a way to chain moves together. example you don't hit the arm bar from whatever position, but you can chain in a different move you might normally not be able to do from initial starting position. (inspired by that bottom side control video)
