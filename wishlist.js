// WISHLIST!

Next set of goals with BJJ game

Be in a dominant position
'AI' does a move against you (maybe it picks at random from moves list?)
Game shows the move the AI is attempting (popup -- something else? TBD)

Just like w/ position modifiers, there are a list of steps you can take for defense.
like, tuck chin, keep elbows in, break grips, etc. (where to store this data? new moves defense file? somewhere else?)

For now, you will click as many or as few of these defenses as you want.
Options:
-- do not defend the move (and then game proceeds as if you had done it to AI; position change, tap, etc)
-- successfully defend the move (and then game stays where it was -- however sometimes defending a move also moves you to a different position or setup, figure out how to handle this. chart out some samples
-- let game decide if you defend or not (50/50 chance)
          -- eventually you can customize the skill level of your opponent, make them easy or hard, etc.


Other things to think about --

% chance that AI will defend a move you do against them
% chance that AI will do a move against you








-- fail submissions

-- % chance of you pulling off a move, aka how good you are at it

-- feature where you can attempt a move but won't make it

-- mode to hide moveslist, or type in the move you want to do

-- opponent will occasionally perform moves against you (time based, round based, how to implement?)

-- click position in history list to return to that postion

-- a way to chain moves together. example you don't hit the arm bar from whatever position, but you can chain in a different move you might normally not be able to do from initial starting position. (inspired by that bottom side control video)


// BUGS!

-- sometimes a bad position is grabbed from position array, why?
