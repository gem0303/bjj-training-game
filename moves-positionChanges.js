Your free leg kicks out to establish a wide base. Turn hips out and get them to the floor. Slide trapped leg out to complete the pass. Might need to repeat widening stance/sliding hips pattern a few times. Can also reach back with free leg to help push against opponent's legs to free your trapped leg (don't let opponent catch both legs). Important to maintain upper body pressure, grips and tightness through the entire pass. Note: this doesn't work against knee shield.",
