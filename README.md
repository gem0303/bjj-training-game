### Disclaimer
This is more of a sandbox than a game. Some of the features (such as position modifiers) don't actually do anything. Others are very unrealistic (like choosing whether you succesfully counter a move or not). Use your imagination to fill in the gaps. Finally, you and your oppponent will occasionally end up in certain mis-matched positions (like standing vs on ground) and the moves list is totally wrong. Until I can get this bug fixed (or implement a system for open guard) please just reset the roll.

### Purpose
I started training BJJ earlier this year. With no prior martial arts experience, I quickly found myself struggling to memorize all the different positions and potential moves I could execute from each position. Building this little simulation game helped me connect the basic pieces together, as well as provide a place to store my notes and useful resources like Youtube videos.

This game is not designed to replicate the complexity, fluidity and creativity of live rolling. This can only be experienced on the mats. Instead, it's intended to help practice some of the mental aspects of rolling: identifying what position you and your opponent are in, knowing what moves are available to you, and the flow of transitioning between holding positions and using techniques.

Remember, there is no substitute for live rolling. Get out there and train!
